# Greenpeace Skunkworks
Geek - _/ɡiːk/_  
__verb__
>_Engage in or discuss computer-related activism obsessively and with great attention to technical detail._

Skunkworks - _/ˈskəNGkˌwərks/_  
__noun__
>_A skunkworks project is a project developed by a small and loosely structured group of people who research and develop a project primarily for the sake of radical innovation._

###What?
An experimental team under the Programme side of the organisation who would support Campaigns, Actions and areas of the organisation outside the purview of current IT responsibilities (but in alignment with the Global IT Strategy).

From planning, to execution the Geeks would be working in direct collaboration with Programme teams. This is not a ‘consultant only’ role. The Geeks must be of the highest technical competency. Bringing the type of ideas and execution that leads to the innovation we so often talk about. Knowing which ideas are audacious but achievable and which ideas sound easy but are in fact bottomless money/time sinks where resources and enthusiasm go to die.

###Why?
So many reasons but I’ll just quote from  the 2013 & 2014 Polar Comms Strategies:
 
In the 1970s and 1980s Greenpeace helped define the zeitgeist. Young people fighting ‘the man’, engaging in daring direct actions to bring images back to an expectant world of whale slaughter or toxic waste dumping. It was fresh, innovative and modern, and it suited the times. High quality handheld camera footage was newly available. Ships were an innovative and audacious new tool. It was also exclusive, but in the early days there was neither the need or facility for widespread participation in Greenpeace campaigns.

Times have changed. Just as the global threat of climate change affects us all, the long heralded interconnected world has now arrived. Modern campaigns - from Greenpeace and other environmental groups - are too often perceived as top down, template activism. To the outside world we have become risk averse in our risk-taking, comfortable in situations that twenty years ago were highly controversial. <br><br>

###Objectives
Successfully partner with a select Global Campaign team to plan and implement innovative solutions to a strategic set of campaign objectives or actions.
Identify a process with timelines and resources to upskill the organisation and roll out some basic tech/campaign skills within 6 months

###Milestones
You need to put milestones in here that your objectives will be measured against.

###Further goals
*   Partner with other Global Campaign groups to build on previous successes.
*   Identify and support the social networking of technically competent staff within NRO’s.
*   Work with the Global Actions team and GPI Legal to engage and partner with leading non-profit organisations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to set standards and guidelines for online engagement within the principles of NVDA. 
*   Draft policies and best practices (with the legal and comms units) around online activism, hacking, etc, for both Greenpeace and third-parties who support our work (ie Anonymous).

Examples

*   Live streaming in harsh/remote conditions: #iceClimb, Arctic, Global South.
*   Mass engagement using (2G) feature phones via USSD.
*   Bypassing censorship and network blocks to enable civil discourse in #Occupy-type offline events. 
*   Targetted 3D Projection & Projection Mapping instead of banner drops.
*   Online NVDA - Culture Jamming {websites:twitter:apps:target systems}



###Team skills & composition:
GP learns best by experiencing success, then by looking at success and emulating it. Bureaucratic theoretical teaching runs a very distant 3rd place.
During the first year the team will concentrate on developing some minimal viable products aimed at some quick wins along with testing some ideas that are so cutting edge we know that a few of them will fail. 

This structure requires a lean team of highly skilled individuals who can drive this innovation with as little bureaucracy as possible. 


###Resources:
1. FTE’s   
2. Operational budget   
3. Enabling budget   
4. Matching budget   

Total: $(?)

This team would benefit initially from a larger budget than a large number of full time team numbers.
Though too small a team and we risk not realising any immediate successes of team goals.
Given the diversity of skills required on quite different projects there will be a necessity to comprise the team with engineers who have both excellent communication skills and domain specific knowledge. Many engineering task require dedicated ‘quiet time’ to accomplish them.
A minimum of three people for one year would be realistic as long as there was the scope to to engage freelancers, contractors or other staff for specific projects.
Initially core team members should be based in similar time zones to aid collaboration.

Success of the experiment and approved requests from other Greenpeace teams would necessitate an increase of team members in more distributed time zones.

###Line management 
International Programme Department (IPD)
Greater autonomy to work with ED’s/Comms/Actions/GCL’s without suffering the ‘silo effect’ of interdepartmental co-operation
Team can’t be used as capacity filler for ‘business as usual’ tasks
