            In the 1970s and 1980s Greenpeace helped define the zeitgeist. Young people fighting ‘the man’, engaging in daring direct actions to bring images back to an expectant world of whale slaughter or toxic waste dumping. It was fresh, innovative and modern, and it suited the times...

            GP learns best by experiencing success, then by looking at success and emulating it. Bureaucratic theoretical teaching runs a very distant 3rd place.<br><br>
            During the first year the team will concentrate on developing some minimal viable products aimed at some quick wins along with testing some ideas that are so cutting edge we know that a few of them will fail. <br><br>

            This structure requires a lean team of highly skilled individuals who can drive this innovation with as little bureaucracy as possible.

            This team would benefit initially from a larger budget than a large number of full time team numbers.<br><br>
            Though too small a team and we risk not realising any immediate successes of team goals.<br><br>
            Given the diversity of skills required on quite different projects there will be a necessity to comprise the team with engineers who have both excellent communication skills and domain specific knowledge. Many engineering task require dedicated ‘quiet time’ to accomplish them.
            A minimum of three people for one year would be realistic as long as there was the scope to to engage freelancers, contractors or other staff for specific projects.<br><br>
            Initially core team members should be based in similar time zones to aid collaboration.<br><br>

            Success of the experiment and approved requests from other Greenpeace teams would necessitate an increase of team members in more distributed time zones.

        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

    <div id="overview" class="step" data-x="500" data-y="500" data-scale="14">

<!--
    
    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
    
    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.
    
    ...
    
    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
    
    Just sayin' ;)
    
-->
<div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
</div>
<script>
if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) { 
    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
}
</script>

<!--
    
    Last, but not least.
    
    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
    
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
    
-->
<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
<script>impress().init();</script>

<!--
    
    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
    
    Just store the result of the call:
    
        var api = impress();
    
    and you will get three functions you can call:
    
        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
    
    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
    
    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.
